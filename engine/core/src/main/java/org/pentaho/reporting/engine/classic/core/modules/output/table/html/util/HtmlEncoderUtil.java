   * CSS Escapes: CSS 2.1 / 4.1.3 Characters and case

   * Third, backslash escapes allow authors to refer to characters they can't easily put in a document. In this case,
   * the backslash is followed by at most six hexadecimal digits (0..9A..F), which stand for the ISO 10646 ([ISO10646])
   * character with that number, which must not be zero. (It is undefined in CSS 2.1 what happens if a style sheet does
   * contain a character with Unicode codepoint zero.) If a character in the range [0-9a-f] follows the hexadecimal
   * number, the end of the number needs to be made clear. There are two ways to do that:
   * <p/>
   * 1. with a space (or other whitespace character): "\26 B" ("&B"). In this case, user agents should treat a "CR/LF"
   * pair (U+000D/U+000A) as a single whitespace character.<br/>
   * 2. by providing exactly 6 hexadecimal digits: "\000026B" ("&B")
   * <p/>
   * In fact, these two methods may be combined. Only one whitespace character is ignored after a hexadecimal escape.
   * Note that this means that a "real" space after the escape sequence must itself either be escaped or doubled.
