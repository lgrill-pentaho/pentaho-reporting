 * A report band that is printed once only at the beginning of the report.

 * A flag can be set forcing the report generator to start a new page after printing the report header.
 * <p/>
 * Note that if there is a page header on the first page of your report, it will be printed above the report header, the
 * logic being that the page header *always* appears at the top of the page. In many cases, it makes better sense to
 * suppress the page header on the first page of the report (leaving just the report header on page 1).
