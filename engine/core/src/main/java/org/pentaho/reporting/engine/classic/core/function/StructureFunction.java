 * A structure function is a annonymous function that modifes the structure of the report or computes changes to the
 * report definition on the current report.
 * <p/>
 * Structure functions are considered to be part of the initial master-report. All events that were generated by
 * subreports are marked as deep-traversing events. The report-definition that is passed in the report-state is always
 * the report definition of the (sub) report that generated the event.
