 * A report band that appears as the very last band on the report.

 * Note that if there is a page footer on the last page of your report, it will be printed below the report footer, the
 * logic being that the page footer *always* appears at the bottom of the page. In many cases, it makes better sense to
 * suppress the page footer on the last page of the report (leaving just the report footer on the final page).
