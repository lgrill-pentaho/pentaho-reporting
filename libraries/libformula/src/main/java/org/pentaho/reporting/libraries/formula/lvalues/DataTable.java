 * A database is a two dimensional collection of data, arranged in a table. Although we do not assume that the whole
 * database is held in memory, we allow random access of the data.
 * <p/>
 * Columns may have names, but there is no enforced requirement for that.

 * As a database is not just a collection of raw data, this interface returns LValues instead of plain objects. Columns
 * may be computed values using formulas (the exact semantics of adressing database cells in a formula is beyond the
 * scope of this specification and is implementation specific).
