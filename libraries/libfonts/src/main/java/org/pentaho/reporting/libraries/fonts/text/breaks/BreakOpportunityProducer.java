 * Checks for break-opportunities. The break opportunity is always a break after the last codepoint, under the
 * condition, that this codepoint does not belong to a grapheme cluster.
 * <p/>
 * This means, if we test the sequence 'ab', we cannot be sure that the letter 'a' is breakable, unless we've seen 'b'
 * and have verified that 'b' is no extension or formatting character.
 * <p/>
 * To use this producer properly, make sure that no extension characters get fed into it.
