/**
 * Defines the floating property. Floating elements create a new flow inside an existing flow.
 * <p/>
 * The properties left and top are equivalent, as as right and bottom. All properties in the specification can be
 * reduced to either left or right in the computation phase.
 * <p/>
 * Floating images cannot leave their containing block vertically or horizontally. If negative margins are given, they
 * may be shifted outside the content area, but vertical margins will increase the 'empty-space' between the blocks
 * instead of messing up the previous element.
