 * The elemnts function. This is a lookup to the current pending context. The elements function grabs the last value
 * from the pending context and drops all previous elements. If the pending context is empty, it preserves its content.
 * <p/>
 * The elements get removed from the normal flow and get added to the pending flow. Due to the highly volatile nature of
 * that step, no - I repeat - no validation is done to normalize inline and block elements.
